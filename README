This is a repo containing work-in-progress SMP initialization code for my hobby
operating system, c4-os. It will be merged in there eventually, but this code
will remain standalone so it can be reused for other things, maybe even by
other people (including you, dear reader!).

There's also a folder containing some code by Erich Boleyn (uruk.org) which was
very useful as a reference.

Building
========

You'll need make, gcc and binutils on x86/amd64, and nasm.

``make'' builds a kernel which should be able to work with any
multiboot-compatible bootloader, including GRUB and syslinux, and qemu's
-kernel option. If you have qemu installed, ``make test'' will run the kernel
with the usual parameters.
