This is a repo containing work-in-progress SMP initialization code for my hobby
operating system, c4-os. It will be merged in there eventually, but this code
will remain standalone so it can be reused for other things, maybe even by
other people (including you, dear reader!).

There's also a folder containing some code by Erich Boleyn (uruk.org) which was
very useful as a reference.
